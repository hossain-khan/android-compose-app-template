## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Follows Circuit pattern with Presenter/Screen separation
- Uses Metro dependency injection
- Repository pattern for data management

### Data Storage
- In-memory storage for drafts and sent messages
- Hardcoded inbox emails for demonstration
- Auto-incrementing IDs for new emails (starting from 100)

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for repository functionality
- Tests cover all CRUD operations and edge cases
- All tests pass and follow the project's testing conventions

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for email functionality. Potential enhancements include:

- Persistent storage (Room database)
- Email validation
- Rich text editing
- Attachments support
- Real email sending integration
- Search and filtering capabilities
