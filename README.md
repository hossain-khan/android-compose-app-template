# Android - Circuit App Template
An Android App template that is preconfigured with ‚ö°Ô∏è Circuit UDF architecture.

> [!TIP]
> Google also has an official architectural template available for starter apps.
> https://github.com/android/architecture-templates

## What do you get in this template? üìú
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) library setup for the app
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Metro](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/) Dependency Injection for all Circuit Screens & Presenter combo
* ‚úîÔ∏è GitHub Actions for CI
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Google font](https://github.com/hossain-khan/android-compose-app-template/blob/main/app/src/main/java/app/example/ui/theme/Type.kt#L9-L14) for choosing different app font.
* ‚úîÔ∏è `BuildConfig` turned on with example of reading config from `local.properties` file.
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Kotlin formatter](https://github.com/jeremymailen/kotlinter-gradle) plugin for code formatting and linting
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent) for scheduling background tasks

> [!WARNING]  
> _This template is only for Android app setup. If you are looking for a multi-platform supported template,_
> _look at the official [Circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) example apps included in the project repository._

### Post-process after cloning üßë‚Äçüè≠

You have **two options** for customizing this template:

#### Option 1: Automated Customization (Recommended) ü§ñ
Run the setup script to automatically handle most of the configuration:

```bash
# Basic usage - removes examples and WorkManager
./setup-project.sh com.mycompany.appname MyAppName

# Keep examples for reference
./setup-project.sh com.mycompany.appname MyAppName --keep-examples

# Keep WorkManager if you need background tasks
./setup-project.sh com.mycompany.appname MyAppName --keep-workmanager --keep-examples

# Keep the script for debugging (useful during development)
./setup-project.sh com.mycompany.appname MyAppName --keep-script
```

**What the script does automatically:**
- Renames package from `app.example` to your preferred package name
- Updates directory structure based on package name
- Updates app name and package ID in XML and Gradle files
- Renames `CircuitApp` to `YourAppNameApp`
- Removes `Example*` files (optional with `--keep-examples`)
- Removes WorkManager files (optional with `--keep-workmanager`)
- Creates a fresh git repository
- Removes template-specific files

#### Option 2: Manual Customization üîß
If you prefer manual control, complete these tasks:

* [ ] Rename the package from **`app.example`** to your preferred app package name.
* [ ] Update directory structure based on package name update
* [ ] Update app name and package id in XML and Gradle
* [ ] Rename `CircuitApp***` to preferred file names
* [ ] Remove `Example***` files that were added to showcase example usage of app and Circuit.
* [ ] Remove WorkManager and Worker example files if you are not using them.

#### Additional Manual Steps (Both Options) üìù
These still need to be done manually after using the script:

* [ ] Update `.editorconfig` based on your project preference
* [ ] Update your app theme colors (_use [Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/)_)
* [ ] Generate your app icon (_use [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)_)
* [ ] Update/remove repository license
* [ ] Configure [renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate) for dependency management or remove [`renovate.json`](https://github.com/hossain-khan/android-compose-app-template/blob/main/renovate.json) file
* [ ] Choose [Google font](https://github.com/hossain-khan/android-compose-app-template/blob/main/app/src/main/java/app/example/ui/theme/Type.kt#L16-L30) for your app, or remove it.
