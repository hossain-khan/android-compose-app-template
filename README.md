### Post-process after cloning 🧑‍🏭
Unfortunately, you **do** have to do some manual work after cloning the template 😅, namely:

* [ ] Rename the package from **`app.example`** to your preferred app package name.
* [ ] Update directory structure based on package name update
* [ ] Update app name and package id in XML and Gradle
* [ ] Update `.editorconfig` based on your project preference
* [ ] Update your app theme colors (_use [Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/)_)
* [ ] Generate your app icon (_use [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)_)
* [ ] Rename `CircuitApp***` to preferred file names
* [ ] Remove `Example***` files that were added to showcase example usage of app and Circuit.
* [ ] Remove WorkManager and Worker example files if you are not using them.
* [ ] Update/remove repository license
* [ ] Configure [renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate) for depenency management or remove [`renovate.json`](https://github.com/hossain-khan/android-compose-app-template/blob/main/renovate.json) file
* [ ] Choose [Google font](https://github.com/hossain-khan/android-compose-app-template/blob/main/app/src/main/java/app/example/ui/theme/Type.kt#L16-L30) for your app, or remove it.
